# Parctice-Question
Aim-: One day this repo will have 1000 coding questions with solution.
1. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/simple-search-4/
2. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/maximum-sum-4-f8d12458/description/
3. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/mannas-first-name-4/description/ (This question is solved in C but in c++ this question "lvalue required as left operand of assignment").
